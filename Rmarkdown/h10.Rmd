BASH SHELL - GREP

Consider once again the Super Bowl baby datasets. The approach taken in
the previous handout was to clean up the file from each year and then
append them together into a single file.

![](img/h10/media/image1.png){width="4.904803149606299in"
height="0.98125in"}

After creating a single file, this file can easily be read in Excel.

![](img/h10/media/image2.png){width="4.78125in"
height="2.0468449256342955in"}

An alternative approach could be to ***pull out only the information
needed*** for our analyses from these files.

-   In 2007, the Indianapolis Colts won the Super Bowl. The county
    associated with the Indianapolis Colts is Marion County, IN. Thus,
    the number of births from this county is needed for our analysis.
    The number of births for Marion County, IN is needed for all years.

-   In 2008 (and 2012), the New York Giants won the Super Bowl. Thus,
    the number of births from Bergen County, NJ is needed across all
    years.

-   Likewise for the remaining years.

  Year   Super Bowl Winner      County
  ------ ---------------------- ----------------------
  2007   Indianapolis Colts     Marion County, IN
  2008   New York Giants        Bergen County, NJ
  2009   Pittsburgh Steelers    Allegheny County, PA
  2010   New Orleans Saints     Orleans Parish, LA
  2011   Green Bay Packers      Brown County, WI
  2012   New York Giants        Bergen County, NJ
  2013   Baltimore Ravens       Baltimore County, MD
  2014   Seattle Seahawks       King County, WA
  2015   New England Patriots   Suffolk County, MA
  2016   Denver Broncos         Denver County, CO
  2017   New England Patriots   Suffolk County, MA

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  MAC users will need to use **gsed** whenever a sed command is used throughout.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the previous handout, the following command was used to KEEP only the
lines that started with \\t from the Babies\_2007.txt file.

\$ sed -n '/\^\\t/p' Babies\_2007.txt

The command above can be modified as shown below to search for Marion
County, IN in each line across several files. The wildcard character is
used to search across years.

\$ sed -n '/Marion County, IN/p' Babies\_20\*.txt &gt;

Colts\_MarionCounty.txt

The wildcard character creates the following data stream for sed.

![](img/h10/media/image3.png){width="6.5in" height="0.30625in"}

A quick glance of this output files reveals that the “Total” rows are
included in this file. Thus, modifications will need to be made to the
above command.

\$ head -20 Colts\_MarionCounty.txt

![](img/h10/media/image4.png){width="3.5in"
height="1.2223818897637795in"}

The following sed command will print the lines that start with \\t AND
contain Marion County, IN. It is necessary to use gsed on a MAC in order
for this command to work.

$$\ \left\{ Start\ with\ \backslash t \right\}\  \cap \{ Contains\ Marion\ County,\ IN\}$$

\$ sed -n '/\^\\t/p’ Babies\_20\*.txt | sed –n ‘/Marion County, IN/p'
&gt; Colts\_MarionCounty.txt

The components of this command are shown here.

![](img/h10/media/image5.png){width="5.268984033245844in"
height="1.15625in"}

The following command is an alternative to the piped command provided
above. The .\* can be interpreted as AND in this context. This approach
appears to be somewhat limiting (I could not get compound .\* commands
to work). Mac users need to use gsed here.

\$ sed -n '\^\\t.\*Marion County, IN' Babies\_20\*.txt &gt;
Colts\_MarionCounty.txt

As seen below the output is as desired; however, notice that information
regarding the Year is not provided. You can add year information to the
file fairly easy as a pattern exists – Jan through Dec is repeated for
each year.

\$ head -20 Colts\_MarionCounty.txt

![](img/h10/media/image6.png){width="4.655999562554681in"
height="2.1086307961504813in"}

*Questions*:

1.  Your colleague suggest that Year information could be added to the
    dataset after bringing it into Excel. She believes the following
    will work. Verify whether or not this will work to label the year
    for each row in the dataset.

=2007+INT(ROW()/12)

1.  Will this function work if more years are added? Discuss.

*EDITING with GREP*

Grep has some advantages over sed when it comes to the management of
strings. Grep stands for *G*lobally search a *R*egular *E*xpression and
*P*rint and appears to be somewhat more sophisticated and flexible than
sed.

Using various grep commands to search for lines that start with \\t AND
contain Marion County, IN.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Utility   Command
            
            Outcome
  --------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Sed       Command: \$ sed -n '/\^\\t/p’ &lt;in-file&gt; | sed –n ‘/Marion County, IN/p' &gt; &lt;out-file&gt;
            
            Outcome: Success – however, no information is provided regarding file origination

  grep      Command: \$ grep '\^\\t’ &lt;in-file&gt; | grep ‘Marion County, IN’ &gt; &lt;out-file&gt;
            
            Outcome: Nothing – grep does not appear to understand \\t using it’s default regex interpreter

            Command: \$ grep '\^\\s’ &lt;in-file&gt; | grep ‘Marion County, IN’ &gt; &lt;out-file&gt;
            
            Outcome: Success – grep does appear to understand the more universal \\s, i.e. whitespace, character in it’s default regex interpreter

            Command: \$ grep –P '\^\\t’ &lt;in-file&gt; | grep –P ‘Marion County, IN’ &gt; &lt;out-file&gt;
            
            Outcome: Success (on PC, not MAC) – interpret search pattern as a Perl regular expression

            Command: \$ grep \$'\^\\t’ &lt;in-file&gt; | grep \$‘Marion County, IN’ &gt; &lt;out-file&gt;
            
            Outcome: Success – uses the ANSI C standard for the string
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consider the following command. This command is using the \\s version
from above. Once again the output for Marion County, IN is being saved
into a file named Colts\_MarionCounty.txt.

\$ grep \$'\^\\t’ Babies\_20\*.txt | grep \$‘Marion County, IN' &gt;
Colts\_MarionCounty.txt

An alternative to the above that does not use piping.

\$ grep \$'\^\\t.\*Marion County, IN' Babies\_20\*.txt &gt;
Colts\_MarionCounty.txt

Use the head command to look at the output file. Notice that the grep
command has left an identifier for each line. This identifier
corresponds to the file from which this line was found. This identifier
is automatically placed in the file whenever a wildcard is being used in
the in-file.

\$ head -20 Colts\_MarionCounty.txt

*GETTING DATA FROM ADDITIONAL COUNTIES\
*

The Marion County, IN data is needed for the Indianapolis Colts (2007
Super Bowl). Data from Bergen County, NJ is needed for the New York
Giants (2008 / 2012 Super Bowl).

  Year   Super Bowl Winner    County
  ------ -------------------- -------------------
  2007   Indianapolis Colts   Marion County, IN
  2008   New York Giants      Bergen County, NJ
  :      :                    :

Thus, all lines start with \\t and are from {Marion County, IN or Bergen
County, NJ} will be needed for our analysis.

$$\left\{ Start\ with\ \backslash t \right\}\  \cap \{ Marion\ County,\ IN \cup Contains\ Bergen\ County,\ NJ\}$$

The grep syntax for the set above is provided here. The left
parenthesis, vertical bar, and right parenthesis characters must be
encapsulated here, i.e. \\(, \\|, and \\). The reason is that by default
grep will look for these characters; however, in this context these
characters are being used to define the desired set of rows to keep.

$$\{ Marion\ County,\ IN \cup Bergen\ County,\ NJ\}$$

![](img/h10/media/image9.png){width="6.5in"
height="0.7979166666666667in"}

The following statement extends to all counties. The output is being
pushed into a file named Babies\_AllData.txt.

\$ grep \$'\^\\t’ Babies\_20\*.txt | grep \$‘\\(Marion County,
IN\\|Bergen County, NJ\\|Allegheny County, PA\\|Orleans Parish,
LA\\|Brown County, WI\\|Baltimore County, MD\\|King County, WA\\)' &gt;
Babies\_AllData.txt

*Comment*: Grep is exact in its searching. For example, if a space is
inadvertently placed before a county name (see below) as grep will be
searching for “\_King County, WA” which is different than “King County,
WA”.

\$ grep \$'\^\\t’ Babies\_20\*.txt | grep \$‘\\(Marion County,
IN\\|Bergen County, NJ\\|Allegheny County, PA\\|Orleans Parish,
LA\\|Brown County, WI\\|Baltimore County, MD\\|\_King County, WA\\)'
&gt; Babies\_AllData.txt

The following word count with line option command can be used to count
the number of lines in this file. This appears to be correct.

12 months x 8 years x 7 unique counties = 672

\$ wc -l Babies\_AllData.txt

672 Babies\_AllData.txt

*ADDING A HEADER*

Using sed with in-place editing to add a header row to the final
dataset.

\$ sed -i '1 i\\File \\t County \\t County Code \\t Month \\t Month Code
\\t Births' Babies\_AllData.txt

Header row has been successfully added – verified via head and with line
count.

\$ head -5 Babies\_AllData.txt

File County County Code Month Month Code Births

Babies\_2007.txt: "Marion County, IN" "18097" "January" "1" 1320

Babies\_2007.txt: "Marion County, IN" "18097" "February" "2" 1219

Babies\_2007.txt: "Marion County, IN" "18097" "March" "3" 1295

Babies\_2007.txt: "Marion County, IN" "18097" "April" "4" 1160

\$ wc -l Babies\_AllData.txt

673 Babies\_AllData.txt

The Babies\_AllData.txt file is ready for analysis. A snip-it of this
file in Excel is shown here.

![](img/h10/media/image10.png){width="4.76799978127734in"
height="2.36in"}

Once in Excel, the Year information can easily be extracted from the
file name.

=MID(A2,FIND(“\_”,A2,1)+1,4)

*Tasks*

Consider the following question about the use of grep.

1.  Consider the grep command that is used to extract data from each of
    the seven counties for the Super Bowl babies investigation.

> \$ grep \$'\^\\t’ Babies\_20\*.txt | grep \$‘\\(Marion County,
> IN\\|Bergen County, NJ\\|Allegheny County, PA\\|Orleans Parish,
> LA\\|Brown County, WI\\|Baltimore County, MD\\|King County, WA\\)'
> &gt; Babies\_AllData.txt

a.  Suppose that you want grep to only search through data files from
    2010 – 2014. How would this command change?

b.  Consider the following variation to the grep command. What years are
    being included here?

> \$ grep \$'\^\\t’ Babies\_201\[2-4\].txt | grep \$‘\\(Marion County,
> IN\\|Bergen County, NJ\\|Allegheny County, PA\\|Orleans Parish,
> LA\\|Brown County, WI\\|Baltimore County, MD\\|King County, WA\\)'
> &gt; Babies\_AllData.txt

1.  What would be the grep command get data for all years, from all
    seven counties, but only for the months October, November, and
    December? *Hint:* The most straight forward approach would be to use
    another pipe somehow.

2.  What would happen to your command above if there was a county named
    October County, MN in this data? Discuss.

The following sed (or gsed on MAC) commands can be used to clean the
1^st^ column that contains the file name from which grep pulled this
line of data. Excel was used above to clean up this field. The following
sed commands are used to clean up this field in Bash.

1.  Use the following substitute functionality of sed to strip off
    Babies\_ and .txt of the 1st column of the Babies\_AllData.txt
    dataset.

> Command \#1: \$ sed -i 's/Babies\_//' Babies\_AllData.txt
>
> Command \#2: \$ sed -i 's/.txt://' Babies\_AllData.txt

a.  What would happen if there were multiple instances of Babies\_ on a
    line? Would all instances of Babies\_ be replaced with nothing or
    only the first? Use a text editor, e.g. Sublime, to add a second
    Babies\_ in a line to check your answer.

b.  What is the impact of the following change to Command \#1?

    Command \#3: \$ sed -i 's/Babies\_//g' Babies\_AllData.txt

<!-- -->

1.  Consider the following commands. What do each of these commands do?
    In Command 6, what is the purpose of the –r option?

    Command \#4: \$ sed -e 's/.//7' Babies\_AllData.txt | head -10

    Command \#5: \$ sed -e 's/.......//' Babies\_AllData.txt | head -10

    Command \#6: \$ sed -r 's/.{7}//' Babies\_AllData.txt | head -10

2.  Consider the following command. What does this command do?

> Command \#7: \$ sed –e 's/\\.\[\^:\]\*://' Babies\_AllData.txt | head
> -10

1.  Using piping to run Command \#6 and \#7 from above. Save the output
    into a file called Babies\_AllData\_Final.txt. Verify that the File
    column includes only the Year and that Babies\_ and .txt have been
    successfully removed.

    Command \#8: \$ sed -r 's/.{7}//' Babies\_AllData.txt | sed
    's/\\.\[\^:\]\*://' &gt; Babies\_AllData\_Final.txt
