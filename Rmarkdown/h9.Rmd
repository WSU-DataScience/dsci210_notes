BASH SHELL

BASH, an acronym for Bourne-Again Shell, is a command language that
allows a data scientist to manage files “outside” of a software package.
BASH allows you to manage files “at the operating system level”. You can
also create and execute shell scripts using BASH – shell scripts can be
used to change or influence the configuration of systems installed on
your computer.

There are different version of BASH that exist. The version that we will
be using in GNU BASH. The following provides instructions on how to
install GNU Bash on PC/MAC machines.

Before using BASH to manage files, let us first understand how to move
around inside of BASH.

Consider the command that identifies your current location.

  Command   Action
  --------- -------------------------------
  \$pwd     Get path of working directory

\$ pwd

/c/Users/CMalone

The path provided here is the same path used in Windows Explorer.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Setting up a folder with contents**
  
  Create a folder named DSCI210 inside the directory specified above. Create a subdirectory called Data. From the course website, download the Babies\_2014.txt and Babies\_2013.txt data files and place them inside the Data subdirectory.
  
  ![](img/h9/media/image8.png){width="2.5729166666666665in" height="1.4270833333333333in"}
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*MOVING AROUND*

The change directory command can be used to move down (or up) the
directory tree-structure.

  Command                  Action
  ------------------------ ----------------------------------------
  cd &lt;folder name&gt;   Move into a folder
  cd ..                    Move up a folder in the directory tree

Move into the DSCI210 folder with the following command.

\$ cd DSCI210

Next, moving into the Data folder.

\$ cd Data

Realize, this could the above two commands can be done in a single step.

\$ cd DSCI210/Data

Identify your current location.

\$ pwd

/c/Users/CMalone/DSCI210/Data

Suppose my current location is within the Data folder and you want to
move into the DSCI415/Notes folder.

  Current location   /c/Users/CMalone/DSCI210/Data
  ------------------ --------------------------------
  Desired location   /c/Users/CMalone/DSCI415/Notes

\$ cd ../../DSCI415/Notes

![](img/h9/media/image9.png){width="1.9375in"
height="1.908902012248469in"}

  Command                     Move out of DSCI210/Data   Move out of DSCI210   Move into DSCI415/Notes
  --------------------------- -------------------------- --------------------- -------------------------
  \$ cd ../../DSCI415/Notes   ../                        ../                   DSCI415/Notes

The movement into another location can be done using the complete path
as well.

\$ cd /c/Users/CMalone/DSCI415/Notes

*LOOKING IN DIRECTORIES / FILES*

The usual method of looking in directories is to click your way through
the directory tree-structure. Likewise, the look at a file, we normally
double-click and the file will open in the particular software package
that is associated with that file type.

![](img/h9/media/image10.png){width="4.572916666666667in"
height="1.0137609361329833in"}

The ls command can be used to identify the contents of the current
directory.

  Command   Action
  --------- --------------------------------------------------------------
  ls        List contents of folder
  ls – l    With the – l option, additional file information is provided
  cat       Print contents of file to screen

\$ ls

Babies\_2013.txt Babies\_2014.txt

The ls command with the –l option provides additional details.

\$ ls -l

total 760

-rw-r--r-- 1 aq7839yd 1049089 370653 Feb 22 09:24 Babies\_2013.txt

-rw-r--r-- 1 aq7839yd 1049089 404752 Feb 22 09:24 Babies\_2014.txt

Next, consider a situation in which management of hundreds of files is
required. For simplicity, suppose all files sit in same directory. In
this situation, it may be nice to get a list of all the files contained
in this directory. That is, instead of pushing the output from the ls
command to the screen, it can be pushed into a file.

![](img/h9/media/image11.png){width="5.273270997375328in"
height="1.9791666666666667in"}

  Command                       Action
  ----------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------
  … &gt; &lt;filename.txt&gt;   Put contents from command into file instead of printing to screen

The following can be used to save the contents from the ls command into
a file called Contents.txt

\$ ls &gt; Contents.txt

The ls command to make sure the Content.txt was created successfully.

\$ ls

Babies\_2013.txt Babies\_2014.txt Content.txt

Looking at the content of this newly created file using the cat command.

\$ cat Content.txt

Babies\_2013.txt

Babies\_2014.txt

Content.txt

  ***Aside:*** The newline characters varies between operating systems. In BASH, it appears that the Contents.txt file has three lines; however, when the file is viewed in Notepad (the standard text editor in Windows), this file appears to only have a single line. Worse, there is no delimiter between the file names.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![](img/h9/media/image12.png){width="3.53125in" height="0.84375in"}
  The line feed, i.e. \\n, character as shown in Notepad++.
  ![](img/h9/media/image13.png){width="2.09375in" height="1.4052646544181977in"}
  Some software programs, e.g. Sublime, are written to automatically identify either type of newline characters. However, some software, e.g. Notepad, is written to only accept their respective version of the newline character.

The cat command prints all lines from the file to the screen. The
head/tail commands can be used to see only the top/bottom lines in a
file.

  Command   Action
  --------- -----------------------------
  head –n   Show top n lines of file
  tail -n   Show bottom n lines of file

BASH commands have the following general structure.

"11. Queens, New York (FIPS code 36081) represents Queens Borough, New
York City."

"12. Richmond County, New York (FIPS code 36085) represents Staten
Island Borough, New York City."

BASH has the ability to work with wildcard characters. Suppose you
wanted to see the first few lines of both Babies\_2013.txt and
Babies\_2014.txt. The wildcard character, i.e. \*, can be used to
accomplish this task.

*Questions*

1.  Suppose the following files were contained in my directory. How
    would one write a single head statement (with wildcards) to show the
    contents of the first few lines for all these files?

*MANAGEMENT/EDITING OF TEXT WITHIN A FILE*

In this section, we will consider the editing of text with in file.
There are various BASH utilities that allow for editing text. The common
utilities include sed (or gsed on MAC) , awk, and grep.

  BASH Utility   Full Name                                        
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------
  sed / gsed     Stream Editor                                    Performs basic text transformations on an input stream
  awk            AWK Language                                     Language for pattern scanning and processing
  grep           Globally search a Regular Expression and Print   Plain-text search utility – regular expression friendly

The sed utility will be used extensively here as only simple text
editing is needed for our work. When the sed command is used, text is
continuously feed into the utility line-by-line.

The man command can be used to get help on most BASH commands. You can
also search Stack Exchange to get help on using BASH.

*Note*: The man command is not available in GitBash.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  \$ man sed
  
  Usage: sed \[OPTION\]... {script-only-if-no-other-script} \[input-file\]...
  
  -n, --quiet, --silent
  
  suppress automatic printing of pattern space
  
  -e script, --expression=script
  
  add the script to the commands to be executed
  
  -f script-file, --file=script-file
  
  add the contents of script-file to the commands to be executed
  
  --follow-symlinks
  
  follow symlinks when processing in place
  
  -i\[SUFFIX\], --in-place\[=SUFFIX\]
  
  edit files in place (makes backup if SUFFIX supplied)
  
  -b, --binary
  
  open files in binary mode (CR+LFs are not processed specially)
  
  -l N, --line-length=N
  
  specify the desired line-wrap length for the \`l' command
  
  --posix
  
  disable all GNU extensions.
  
  -r, --regexp-extended
  
  use extended regular expressions in the script.
  
  -s, --separate
  
  consider files as separate rather than as a single continuous
  
  long stream.
  
  -u, --unbuffered
  
  load minimal amounts of data from the input files and flush
  
  the output buffers more often
  
  -z, --null-data
  
  separate lines by NUL characters
  
  --help display this help and exit
  
  --version output version information and exit
  
  If no -e, --expression, -f, or --file option is given, then the first
  
  non-option argument is taken as the sed script to interpret. All
  
  remaining arguments are names of input files; if no input files are
  
  specified, then the standard input is read.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  MAC users will need to use **gsed** whenever a sed command is used throughout.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first step will be to remove the footer information in this file.
The footer information starts with the line containing “---“.

![](img/h9/media/image20.png){width="3.5in"
height="2.9024573490813648in"}

The following sed command can used to find the lines that contain “---“.

\$ sed -e '/"---"/=' Babies\_2007.txt

Breaking this command into it’s pieces.

![](img/h9/media/image21.png){width="4.447916666666667in"
height="1.2130686789151357in"}

The above sed command simply prints the output, i.e. the line number for
which “---“ is contained, to the screen. If you’d like to push the
output into a file, simple use the following command.

\$ sed -e '/"---"/=' Babies\_2007.txt &gt; Babies\_2007\_2.txt

*Questions*

1.  Open Babies\_2007\_2.txt in a text editor. Did the command above
    print the line numbers for each occurrence of “---“?

2.  What does the following command do? Briefly discuss.

    \$ sed -n '/"---"/=' Babies\_2007.txt

The rm command is used to remove (or delete) a file. Be very careful in
using rm with wildcards!

\$ rm Babies\_2007\_2.txt

We now know that the footer information in this file begins on line
7439. The relevant content of the file can be obtained using the head
command. The first command below simply prints the output (the first
7438 lines) to the screen; whereas, the second version saves the output
into a new file called Babies\_2007\_v2.txt.

\$ head -7438 Babies\_2007.txt

\$ head -7438 Babies\_2007.txt &gt; Babies\_2007\_v2.txt

The next step in the management of these files is to remove the rows
that do not contain data for each county. We can accomplish this take in
two distinct ways – either delete the non-data rows or keep the data
rows. The “keep data rows” approach is shown first.

![](img/h9/media/image22.png){width="4.8125in"
height="2.312159886264217in"}

Now, the following command uses sed to print, i.e. keep, only lines that
begin with \\t. The –n option is used to suppress the printing of
content to the screen.

Note: Replace sed with gsed on a MAC to force the use of GNU Bash.

\$ sed -n '/\^\\t/p' Babies\_2007\_v2.txt &gt; Babies\_2007\_v3.txt

The following breaks this command down into its various components.

![](img/h9/media/image23.png){width="5.625in"
height="1.0042071303587052in"}

The following variation of the command above can be used to delete all
non-data rows – i.e. rows that start with “ are non-data rows. Rows that
contain data start with \\t.

![](img/h9/media/image24.png){width="4.114583333333333in"
height="2.0230030621172355in"}

\$ sed -e '/\^”/d' Babies\_2007\_v2.txt &gt; Babies\_2007\_v3.txt

*Note*: The –n option must be changed to –e here. This is necessary as
–n suppresses printing and the letter d (at the end of the quoted
string) deletes the output. Thus, an empty file would be returned if –n
were not changed to –e.

The last step in the management of these files is to add the year to
each line. This can be done using the following substitute functionality
which is specified at the beginning of quoted string. Again, gsed should
be used in place of sed here on a MAC.

\$ sed -e 's/\\t/2007\\t/' Babies\_2007\_v3.txt &gt;
Babies\_2007\_v4.txt

  Babies\_2007\_v3.txt                                                                       Babies\_2007\_v4.txt
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![](img/h9/media/image25.png){width="2.8536154855643043in" height="1.523147419072616in"}   ![](img/h9/media/image26.png){width="3.1638035870516186in" height="1.4953707349081364in"}

The following table provides variations of the substitute command.

  Substitute Commands                                 Action
  --------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------
  sed –e ‘s/old\_text/new\_text/’ &lt;filename&gt;    Replace the 1^st^ instance of old\_text in the line with new\_text
  sed –e ‘s/old\_text/new\_text/g’ &lt;filename&gt;   Replace all instances of old\_text in the line with new\_text
  sed –e ‘s/\^/new\_text/’ &lt;filename&gt;           Put new\_text at beginning of line
  sed –e ‘s/\$/new\_text/’ &lt;filename&gt;           Put new\_text at end of line

The -i option can be used to for **in-place editing**. The following
command will take the Babies\_2007\_v3.txt file, find the first instance
of \\t and replace it with 2007\\t, and then put the output directly
back into Babies\_2007\_v3.txt.

\$ sed -i 's/\\t/2007\\t/' Babies\_2007\_v3.txt

*Questions*

1.  Consider Statement \#1 – the command used above. What happens if
    Statement \#2 were used instead? Discuss.

    Statement \#1: \$ sed -e 's/\\t/2007\\t/' Babies\_2007\_v3.txt

    Statement \#2: \$ sed -e 's/\\t/2007/' Babies\_2007\_v3.txt

2.  What does the following command do? Discuss.

> \$ sed -e 's/\^/2007/' Babies\_2007\_v3.txt

1.  Consider the statement written in the previous problem – identified
    as Statement \#3 here. What adverse effect would Statement \#4 have?
    Discuss.

    Statement \#3: \$ sed -e 's/\^/2007/' Babies\_2007\_v3.txt

    Statement \#4: \$ sed -e 's/\^/2007\\t/' Babies\_2007\_v3.txt

2.  Verify that the following command indeed replaces all tab
    characters, i.e.\\t, with 2007.

\$ sed -e 's/\\t/2007/g' Babies\_2007\_v3.txt

1.  What command would be used to place the year at the end of each
    line. You should carefully consider the placement of any tab and/or
    new line characters.

The repeated processing of a file can be streamlined using piping.

  Saving files at each step                                                                  Concept of Piping Command
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using piping to prepare the Babies\_2007.txt file for appending.

\$ head -7438 Babies\_2007.txt | sed -n '/\^\\t/p' | sed -e
's/\\t/2007\\t'/ &gt; Babies\_2007\_v2.txt

The following piped commands are used to prepare the datasets from each
year.

*Note*: The footer content of the 2014 files starts on a different line.

  Year   Piped Command for Preparing each Year
  ------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  2007   \$ head -7438 Babies\_2007.txt | sed -n '/\^\\t/p' | sed -e 's/\\t/2007\\t/' &gt; Babies\_2007\_v2.txt

The following use of head will verify that each file has the correct
format. This should be done before appending the files together.

\$ head -2 Babies\_20\*\_v2.txt

*APPENDING FILES in BASH*

The next step is to append the files from the individual years into a
single file. The cat command can be used to accomplish this task. The
full dataset is being placed into a file called Babies\_AllYears.txt.

\$ cat Babies\_2007\_v2.txt Babies\_2008\_v2.txt Babies\_2009\_v2.txt

Babies\_2010\_v2.txt Babies\_2011\_v2.txt Babies\_2012\_v2.txt

Babies\_2013\_v2.txt Babies\_2014\_v2.txt &gt; Babies\_AllYears.txt

The use of wildcards makes this statement must easier.

\$ cat Babies\_20\*\_v2.txt &gt; Babies\_AllYears.txt

![](img/h9/media/image30.png){width="3.32870406824147in"
height="2.3539206036745406in"}

The wc command with the –l option will quickly count the number of lines
in the file.

\$ wc -l Babies\_AllYears.txt

55560 Babies\_AllYears.txt

This count matches the sum of the number of lines from each individual
year. A check of this nature provides confidence that appending has
worked as intended.

\$ wc -l Babies\_20\*\_v2.txt

6864 Babies\_2007\_v2.txt

6864 Babies\_2008\_v2.txt

6864 Babies\_2009\_v2.txt

7512 Babies\_2014\_v2.txt

*ADDING a HEADER*

The following sed command (using the –i, i.e. in-place, option) can be
used to insert column headers on the first line of this file. The column
headers should be tab delimited like the rest of this file so that the
headers match the columns of data.

\$ sed -i '1 i\\Year \\t County \\t County Code \\t Month \\t Month Code
\\t Births' Babies\_AllYears.txt

The preparation of these files is complete. The Babies\_AllYears.txt
file can now be read into Excel for further analyses. A snip-it of the
Excel file is shown here.

*ANALYSIS of DATA*

The analysis requires the identification of the Super Bowl winner for
each year and the county in which the teams plays. The table below
provides a single county for each team. A more thorough analysis could
include additional counties for each team.

Using PivotTables in Excel is the most efficient in getting the
necessary summaries. Setup a PivotTable as below. Notice that County is
being used as a filter on these summaries. This will allow us to easily
summarize the data for each winning Super Bowl team.

*Questions*

1.  Does the claim of “Super Bowl Babies” appear to be real phenomena?
    Discuss.

2.  Consider our analysis for the Indianapolis Colts (2007). Identify
    additional counties that surround Marion County, IN. Recreate the
    graph provided above using these additional counties. Does the same
    trend appear? Discuss.

*TASK*

The CDC continually updates their datasets and hence our analyses can be
updated using this new data.

Data Sources:

-   <https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D66>

-   <https://wonder.cdc.gov/natality-cur_vrent.html>

Complete the following:

1.  Download the Babies\_2015.txt file from our course website.

2.  Edit this file so that the footer information is removed, the non
    \^\\t rows are removed, and add 2015 to the beginning of each line.

3.  Append the 2015 data to the bottom of Babies\_AllYears.txt.

4.  Read the Babies\_AllYears.txt file into Excel and update the 2007
    Indianapolis Colts graph provided above to include a line for 2015.

5.  Create a graph for the 2015 Super Bowl winner the New England
    Patriots.
