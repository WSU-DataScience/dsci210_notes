Working with Columns
====================

Reordering and renaming columns
-------------------------------

You can re-order the columns by clicking the drop-down menu at the top
of the first column (labelled 'All'), and choosing 'Edit
columns->Re-order / remove columns â€¦'

You can then drag and drop column names to re-order the columns, or
remove columns completely if they are not required.

Sorting data
------------

You can sort data in OpenRefine by clicking on the drop-down menu for
the column you want to sort on, and choosing 'Sort'.

Once you have sorted the data, a new 'Sort' drop-down menu will be
displayed.

Unlike in Excel, 'Sorts' in OpenRefine are temporary - that is, if you
remove the 'Sort', the data will go back to its original 'unordered'
state. The 'Sort' drop-down menu lets you amend the existing sort (e.g.,
reverse the sort order), remove existing sorts, and/or make sorts
permanent.

You can sort on multiple columns at the same time by adding another
sorted column (in the same way).
